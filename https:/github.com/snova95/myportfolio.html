												<h3>Artefacts (1)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Title 1: Network and Information Security Management: History & Definitions.<br/> 
												Description: In unit 1, I experienced fundamental security management which contains Information networking issues relating to common threats and vulnerabilities. During the Collaborative learning discussion 1, a case study named “Compromising a medical mannequin” was the topic to discuss regarding the security and safety measures of the medical devices and equipment, which should be taken under consideration.<br/>
												For my further contribution evidence, please go to this URL-  https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=259001  <br/>
												
												Peer feedback 1: In unit 1, Rashid (2021) agreed that technology increases, hospitals use technology that offers cyber thieves an advantage, and the study I indicates that for the eighth year in a row, the health department is infringing on data. For evidence - https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=259001<br/>
												
												Sending feedback: Regarding 2FA was the term where I suggested Anum to justify the process of the second layer of protection to secure 100%, the evidence- https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=256232#/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=256232&postid=942929 <br/>
												
												  
												Self-evaluation: Wireless data encryption, the strength of the credentials, wireless firewalls, and access restriction might make the safety more acute.<br/>
												 
												•	Title 2: Real-World Issues and Implications of Information Security Threats and Vulnerabilities.<br/>
												 
												Description: In unit 2, we discussed the STRIDE and Dread modelling tool to testify the vulnerability issues regarding business/hospital/organisational sectors. For the group contribution evidence, please visit this URL- https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CW9N6b_DOj4YrtKHAcgCm6G7aFRtBaWMWLjVP_TUeNU/edit#slide=id.p <br/>
												 
												Self-evaluation: It is quite possible to mitigate any ongoing, even future security risk by STRIDE and DREAD modelling tools since it consists of a wide range of safety measures considering the vulnerabilities (spoofing, tampering, Daniel of service, or any information disclosure).<br/>
												 
												 
												•	Title 3: Network Fundamentals<br/>
												 
												Description: In unit 3, I gathered the basic approach of TCP/IP, OSI model and their mapping regarding how the layers are added to custom the security measures. <br/>
												 
												Self-evaluation: A very high level of dependability offered for transmitting data is a key advantage of the TCP/IP protocol. Since the Protocol ensures, while a packet of data is anyhow lost/erased via one route, that it can reach its destination via the secondary route. <br/>
												•	Title 4:  Basic Network Investigation Using Standard Tool <br />
 
                                             Description: In unit 4, the Collaborative learning discussion 2 aided us to gather knowledge about the technical performance regarding different tools (Nmap, Harvester, OpenVas etc.). To define the different functionality and capability of several tools, I was recommended to use and examine the DirBuster on a targeted domain host. For the self-contribution evidence, please visit-  https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=267089 <br />
 
                                             Self-evaluation: Among a wide range of vulnerability scanning tools, I gained the critical expediency of the other scanning way to identify the risk. The URL of my summary post: https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=267108 <br />

												<h3>Artefacts (2)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>•	Title 5: Network Tools and Components <br />
 
												Description: In unit 5, I congregated the first principles of the security implications using the security components incorporate with two different networks (LAN and WAN), and the advanced functions of routers, gateways and firewalls. Aniruddha et al, (2014) stated that Packet Filters are the standard IP-operating firewall method that checks every IP packet for filter rules before it is sent on (or not passed to its destination). <br />
												 
												Self-evaluation: The security of information is an ongoing effort that never ends. The distinctive qualities and applicability of each information security approach. To guarantee the best possible safety, a wide range of solutions must be implemented and who has access to what resources and that information must be monitored.<br />
												 
												•	Title 6: An Evaluation of Commonly Utilised Network Scanning and Penetration Testing Tools<br />
												 
												Description: In unit 6 of the development team project we were recommended to submit the design document proposal considering various justified tools which were selected to use based on its compatibility. However, there were exceptions to utilise every tool, therefore had different outputs, limitations. The team output is here-  https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=500391 . Therefore, we experienced 3 medium, 4 extreme, and 4 high among those risk and business assessment section, here is the link- -  https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=500391 <br />
												 
												Self-evaluation: The threat landscape is the context, where I experienced how it contents different security risks under a particular sector which consists of the client’s credentials. Therefore, we recognised the most suitable and critical ports to identify the safety of e-commerce payment servicing methods.<br />
												•	Title 7: Risks and Standards<br />
												 
												Description: In unit 7, the business continuity, disaster recovery and the basic components of GDPR were suggested to demonstrate.<br />
												 
												Self-evaluation: I pursued the idea of data transparency, data limitation, accuracy, and updated versions of the documents. The importance of the up to date security patches, personal security of the documentation in every employee of the company also should be considered
												 
												•	Title 8: How to Evaluate and Apply Applicable Security Standards<br />
												 
												Description: In unit 8, we were suggested to choose one case study to reflect the idea critically regarding mitigations based on GDPR. For the evidence, please visit my contribution to collaborative learning discussion 3 - https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=266939 , and the summarization of it is here - https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=266939. <br />
												
												Peer feedback 2: In unit 8, Rashid (2021) stated that she would make sure that the firm provides detailed training on the GDPR concerns being an information Security Manager in order to avoid this problem and she would also guarantee that all opt-out requests are properly fulfilled through daily reviews. For evidence: https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=266898 <br />
												
												Sending feedback: I agreed upon the idea of Rashid (2021) where I included the majority of the directives are under the GDPR. For the link- https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=267051#/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=267051&postid=942912 <br />
												
												 
												Self-evaluation: From the personal perspective, among the best practised that it allows, GDPR compels companies to develop or possibly have a substantial impact on a thorough and ongoing conformity plan should be the most significant role in the IT industry.<br />

											<p><•	Title 9: System Logging and Forensics <br />
 
												Description: In unit 9, the system logging and analysing tools monitors were the special tasks to be performed. Ravel and Verma (2017) prescribed that organizations that do not respect the necessity of logging and monitoring may be confronted by problems in the event of a breach, incident or inadequate data management procedures owing to lack of records and proof. <br / >
												 
												Self-evaluation: Log data sources must enable situations of commercial usage; else they will be valuable. <br />
												 
												Title 10: Analysing and Mitigating Security Breaches <br />
												 
												Description: In unit 10, we discovered some famous data breaches which occurred during the 21st century which includes Yahoo, Equifax, eBay, Uber, Target Stored. <br />
												 
												Self-evaluation: One major compatibility of the data breaches mentioned above has some common scenarios such as weakness in the payment service sections, less secured credentials, or backup storage which are a highly concerning issue. <br />
												 
												Title 11: Future Trends, Technologies and Challenges for the Information Security Industry <br />
												 
												Description: Unit 11 contained two things: 1) Debate regarding “It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on the MobilityFirst architecture” (Team 3). The overview of the topic is - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/840913191852179490/868431927722512414/2656877.2656888.pdf  where we delivered the elaboration, and 2) the Development Team Project: Executive Summary which is linked here - https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=500430 <br />
												 
												Self-evaluation: A compliance test was carried out to identify difficulties facing the applications with the key directives of the specified domain (e.g. GDPR, PCI DSS). Each vulnerability was associated with a mitigating mechanism depending on each directive. <br />
